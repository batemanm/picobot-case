picobot-case
============

A case for a 4tronix PicoBot (http://4tronix.co.uk/blog/?p=601).

To assemble the case remove the ball wheel from the front of the
picobot place the bottom half of the case on and secure it to
the ball wheel using the screws that came with the PicoBot. The
top half of the case just pushes down on to the top.

It prints well at 0.2 in ABS.
